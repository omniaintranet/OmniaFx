# Create an Omnia block

Lets create an simple Omnia block.

First, create a new folder under `..\client\{new folder}` in your extension web project. 

Inside the newly created folder, run the following cmd:

```
omnia dev new omniablock --name HelloOmniaFxBlock --tokens element=hello-omnia-fx-block
```

Build and start the project.

Try to add the block to a layout and edit its settings.

Enjoy!
