# Create an Admin Journey

Omnia Admin uses a 'Blades' system. 

Each side nav will lead to an Admin Journey component which contains a collection of blades.

In this part of tutorial, you will create a common admin journey component with 2 blades. 

# Step 1. Create a journey

Create a new folder called `admin` under `..\HelloOmniaFx.Web\client\`.

Inside the newly created folder, run the following cmd:

```
omnia dev new adminjourney -n HelloOmniaFxAdminJourney -t element="hello-omnia-fx-admin-journey"
```

# Step 2. Test the result

Build and start the project.

Press `Shift + O` then `Shift + C` to open the `Omnia Admin`. 

Enjoy!
