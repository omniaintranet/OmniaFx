# Get My Events From Graph API

This sample shows a simple implementation for fetching your events for today using Graph API (which is exposed by Omnia).

Sample picture below:


## Installation

1. Create a script block in Omnia
2. Paste HTML and JS from the files (JavaScript is in a file ending in .ts because this repository .gitignores .js files)
3. Disable "show in iFrame" in script block's settings

And you're done!

## Improvements backlog

1. Profile picture is hardcoded, should be changed to query from omnia.user
